                    I played a key role in a development team of five, contributing to the creation and development of a health data-driven application. My responsibilities included implementing the user interface and functionalities using frontend frameworks, and utilizing cloud services for backend implementation, including deployment and database management. I designed and implemented a backend server to manage data processing and storage from the frontend. To ensure the software's longevity, I created comprehensive documentation for the codebase. Additionally, I actively participated in daily meetings, managed tasks using project management boards, conducted unit tests to ensure application stability, and provided feedback on 50% of the bugs discovered during testing and debugging.
